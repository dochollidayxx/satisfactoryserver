# Satisfactory Server Deployment
Brought to you with extra helpings of Azure!

## Usage

I'm not really going to write detailed instructions here for now.  I recommend checking out the ARM template provided, and the many many MANY SteamCMD based docker images in existence.  This was part of my attempts to get this to work in a more secure way before giving up and accepting the status quo.  

## Features On the _TODO_ List
- [ ] Automated Deployment via Azure ARM Templates / Git Actions
- [ ] Adding telemetry output & alerting for server outages
- [ ] Best-of custom INI files
- [ ] A LOT of refactoring out of hard coded values.
- [ ] Consistency with punctuation                ^^
